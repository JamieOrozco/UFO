## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Dana might use the new webpage by using the new search criteria. The final result was the working website that allowed for five different categories to filter the data: date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The website displays that data in the form of a well structured table with UFO's sighting date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments.

## Summary and Recommendations

* The order to the filters are important and may not populated the data requested if not ordered properly.
* Show input filter values
* Find for data outside of the US
